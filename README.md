Maryo Game

Simple game of Mario made with python using pygame library.
Use it for reference to start a bigger and better approach than this game.
I hope this helps someone. (I do, most certainly)

I have uploaded the images and the music I've used in the game in a compressed folder under the name of Images. (I forgot to change the name.)
